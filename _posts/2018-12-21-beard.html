          This is the first big project weâ€™re doing with the inheritance from my late Grandma Rice. We realized as we were going through her old yearbook that her friends called her Spigot (or Spiggott) since her last name at the time was Fawcett. It also seemed that one friend filled in an entire page of her yearbook. Seeing that yearbook revealed a side of her that I never knew. I remember her as chatty, full of energy and optimistic, but also somewhat proper. She got dressed up and went to her Presbyterian church every Sunday. Even in her last years, she and her friends in her retirement home got dressed up quite fancy to go to dinner with each other. I had a hard time imagining anyone calling her Spiggott. During our search for a new kitchen faucet, I thought of her often.
